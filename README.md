This is the backup of my website, https://woord.dvanb.nl. The only reason it is
on GitHub is that this is an easy remote backup; I've lost entirely too many
of these statically generated blog things to bit rot and backup negligence.

For the curious, it depends on [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) and
[pelican](https://getpelican.com).
