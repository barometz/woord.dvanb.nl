I don't like needing things, biologically. It's an annoying fact that I need
to eat and breathe, but I've come to terms with those. I also use a bunch of
medication to keep it together neurologically and mucous..y, and I've come to
terms with that although I'm trying to reduce the former.

What I don't much like is depending on coffee to function, and our collective
obsession with it is kind of unsettling. So starting today I'm doing without
caffeine for a bit, to see how that goes. And part of science is writing
things down before and after, so here goes.

The rules:

- No coffee.
- No tea.
- Tisane (a distinction I don't usually bother with, but relevant here) like
  rooibos and fennel tea is fine.
- No caffeine supplements, unless it's as part of a painkiller which I will
  log.
- I will log my experience daily.

I can't be an objective observer in this and I don't have any tools to measure
focus or productivity, so the logs - as long as I keep them up - will just be
prose.

A possible confounder here is that I have ADHD and take methylphenidate for
that.
