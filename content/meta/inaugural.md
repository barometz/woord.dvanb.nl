Title: Obligatory Inaugural
Category: Meta
Status: published

This website was put together, mostly out of boredom and curiosity, by someone
with no writing credentials or any recent writing experience outside of
technical work, as this sentence shows.

It is a [yak shaving][yak] problem twice-removed - I know for sure that I had
an idea some time last week about something I could write about, but by now I
don't recall what that idea was. I did in the meantime set up a new VPS,
configure [lighttpd][], get my first-ever [TLS certificate][letsencrypt], set
up [HSTS][] and set up a [blogging tool][pelican]. All things that were
clearly necessary for me to write things on the internet, but now I have
nothing to write about.

## Goal of this blough

I want to write, more than I want to be read. I like to imagine that I want
people to like my convoluted ramblings, but really my #1 goal here is to write
more. It's been years since I last wrote anything longish-form that isn't a
technical specification or design document. The goal of this blough, then, is
for me to have a place where Serious Writing happens that other people might
even see. I could do that in a diary, but the context of its presentation
affects how I approach the work.
